# Blush
This CircuitPython project is part of my work called "Blush". 

You can find the full project here: https://nanyij.cargo.site/Blush

Blush is a robot created using Circuit Playground Express with Crickit. It can get nervous and blushes when something is getting close and will start to listen. When it heard enough, it will reluctantly give out a candy. The intention behid Blush is as simple as delivery little happiness who walk close to it.
